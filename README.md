Submission for the TrojanHacks Fall 2019 Hackathon!

Currently hosted at http://303.itpwebdev.com/~scottmai/usc-club-hub/

The USC Club Hub allows USC students to connect with student organizations
at USC that they may not have been aware of. The clubs are sorted by category
in a very friendly Netflix-style carousel interface. The backend is written in
PHP with heavy usage of MySQL.
